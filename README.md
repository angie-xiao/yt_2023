## 2023 YouTube Statistics - Popularity, Earnings, Views, and Growth.

This is a descriptive project that explores and illustrates answers to these following questions:

1. What are some realistic earning expectations for an “average” YouTube creator?
2. What are the best metrics predicting earnings?
3. Do more uploads mean more subscribers, views, and higher earnings?
4. Who’s the most popular YouTube creator?
5. Where are they from?
6. What are the most popular categories on YouTube?

Users (e.g. creators and marketing agencies) could use findings in this project for purposes including but limited to:
1. Resource planning
   - How many uploads should we make to meet the earning goal?
   - How many staff members should we hire, if we could expect X earnings, based on our monthly views?
2. Strategic Planning
   -  What's the most popular category right now that we have the best shot to get the highest number of subscribers?

The dataset, [Global YouTube Statistics 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-youtube-statistics-2023), was obtained from Kaggle.
